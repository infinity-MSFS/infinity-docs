# Infinity

Welcome to Infinity — a development studio and technology platform dedicated to delivering high-fidelity aircraft systems and next-generation tooling for Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020/2024).
We not only build the Infinity Manager ecosystem (TacLink, DRM, updater, and more) but also develop premium WASM modules and avionics systems for commercial MSFS aircraft, pushing well beyond the default limitations of the simulator.

## Infinity Manager

A unified ecosystem for MSFS add-ons. The Manager handles purchasing, installation, updates, configuration, and developer integration — all through a streamlined user interface.

## TacLink

[TacLink](TacLink.md) is a cutting-edge multiplayer and networking framework engineered for high-performance military simulation. TacLink enables features like air-to-air TACAN, synchronized radar, AAR support, combat systems,  and more.

## Infinity DRM

A secure, MSFS-optimized digital rights management and licensing system enabling studios to safely distribute payware aircraft without compromising the user experience.

## WASM Systems Development

Infinity designs and implements top-tier WASM modules for payware aircraft — including advanced avionics, flight systems, navigation suites, custom displays, and more — built with performance, accuracy, and maintainability at the core.
